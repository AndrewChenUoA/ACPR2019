<div>
<h3>Call for Tutorials</h3>
<b>The ACPR 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for the Tutorial Program, to be held on Tuesday November 26th, 2019.</b><br/><br/>
ACPR 2019 Tutorials should serve one or more of the following objectives, and the duration of each Tutorial presentation should be max 3.5 hours.
<ul>
<li>Introduce students and newcomers to major topics of Pattern Recognition (PR) and related areas.</li>
<li>Provide instructions on established practices and methodologies.</li>
<li>Survey a mature area of PR research and/or practice.</li>
<li>Motivate and explain a PR topic of emerging importance.</li>
<li>Introduce expert non-specialists to a PR subarea.</li>
</ul><br/>

Proposals should be up to four pages in length, and should contain the following information: 
<ul>
<li>Title of the tutorial.</li>
<li>A brief description of the tutorial, suitable for inclusion in the conference registration brochure.</li>
<li>A detailed outline of the tutorial containing abstract, objectives and motivation.</li>
<li>Characterization of the potential target audience for the tutorial, including prerequisite knowledge as well as timeliness.</li>
<li>A description of why the tutorial topic would be of interest to a substantial part of the ACPR audience.</li>
<li>A brief resume of the presenter(s), which should include name, postal address, phone number, e-mail address, web page, background in the tutorial area, any available example of work in the area (ideally, a published tutorial-level article on the subject), evidence of teaching experience (including references that address the proposer's presentation skills), and evidence of scholarship in the area.</li>
<li>Mention whether a similar tutorial has been presented in the last three years ICPR, ACPR or other IAPR conferences and how your one is different from that.</li>
<li>The name and e-mail address of the corresponding presenter. The corresponding presenter should be available for e-mail correspondence during the evaluation process, in the case clarifications and discussions on the scope and content of the proposal are needed.</li>
</ul><br/>

The evaluation of the proposal will take into account its general interest for ACPR attendees, the quality of the proposal (e.g., a tutorial that simply lists a set of concepts without any apparent rationale behind them will not be approved) as well as the expertise and skills of the presenters. We emphasize that the primary criteria for evaluation will be whether a proposal is interesting, well-structured, and motivated in relation to the area of Pattern Recognition, rather than the perceived experience/standing of the proposer.<br/><br/>

Last but not least, the tutorial should attract a meaningful audience, cover hot topics and incorporate new knowledge to the community. Those submitting a proposal should keep in mind that tutorials are intended to provide an overview of the field; they should present reasonably well established information in a balanced way. Tutorials should not be used to advocate a single avenue of research, nor should they promote a product.<br/><br/>

All proposals should be submitted by electronic mail to the Tutorial Co-Chairs, Michael Blumenstein <<a href="mailto:michael.blumenstein@uts.edu.au">michael.blumenstein@uts.edu.au</a>>, Ujjwal Maulik <<a href="mailto:umaulik@cse.jdvu.ac.in">umaulik@cse.jdvu.ac.in</a>, <a href="mailto:ujjwal_maulik@yahoo.com">ujjwal_maulik@yahoo.com</a>>, and Yukiko Kenmochi <<a href="mailto:yukiko.kenmochi@esiee.fr">yukiko.kenmochi@esiee.fr</a>>, no later than March 31, 2019. Feedback, comments and/or suggestions should be provided within two weeks of receiving the proposal. Final acceptance (or rejection) would be decided by April 15, 2019.<br/><br/>

A tutorial presenter will have the fee waived for ACPR 2019 registration (i.e. one fee waiver per 3h - 3.5 h tutorial). Also, lecture notes can be published on the USB to be distributed at the conference if received prior to 21 Oct, 2019.<br/><br/>
