<b>Title of Talk: Is it Possible to Localize a Camera without Matching?</b><br/>
Abstract: SLAM attracts much interest both from academic and industrial communities. Marker-based SLAM methods, using planar markers, are fairly easy to implement. However, existing methods typically need to identify multiple points (markers or key points) in images for matching points in 2D or 3D space. If cameras move fast and are far away from markers or key points, matching may generate errors. If there are only a few points, even RANSAC cannot remove incorrect matching. This will make camera pose tracking unstable and failing. Due to these issues, I studied possibilities of localizing a camera without point matching. Indeed, it is possible to localize a camera without matching. In this talk, I will present designed markers and feature extraction using Polar-N-Direction geometric distances. Then, the camera pose is estimated analytically in a very concise way. Corresponding demos and robustness analysis will be presented.<br/><br/>

<b>Title of Talk: Multimodal Learning for Robust and Privacy Preserving Analytics</b><br/>
Abstract: Miniature high-quality cameras and associated sensors are increasingly worn by people and embedded in robots. The pervasiveness of these sensors is offering countless opportunities to improve services and applications through the recognition of actions, activities and interactions. However, despite this richness in sensing modalities, inferences from these data are particularly challenging due to unconventional and rapidly changing capturing conditions. In this talk I will present the main challenges in learning, classification and processing body-camera signals and show how exploiting multiple modalities helps address these challenges. In particular I will discuss action recognition and audio-visual person re-identification as specific application examples. Moreover, as these applications pose important societal challenges, I will show how to design on-device machine learning models for privacy preserving services.<br/><br/>

<b>Title of Talk: AI at Dawn - Opportunities and Challenges</b><br/>
Abstract: Since the concept of the Turing machine was first proposed in 1936, the capability of machines to perform intelligent tasks went on to grow exponentially. Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an essential accelerator, pursues the target of making machines as intelligent as human beings. It has already reformed how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. In this talk, I will review our recent progress on AI by introducing some representative advancements from algorithms to applications, and illustrate the stairs for realization from perceiving to learning, reasoning, and behaving. To push AI from the narrow to the general, many challenges lie ahead. I will bring some examples out into the open, and shed lights on our future target. Today, we teach machines how to be intelligent as ourselves. Tomorrow, they will be our partners to step into our daily life.<br/><br/>
