  The programme of ACPR 2019 will be single track, including keynotes, oral presentations, posters (with 1 minute brief oral presentations before the posters), tutorials, workshops and demos as in previous editions of ACPR. 
  We expect more than 400 submissions with an acceptance rate below 50 per cent. Approximately 100 researchers will be asked to join the ACPR 2019 programme committee. 
  <br/><br/>
  
  The proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs">Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science</a> (LNCS, indexed in the ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Google Scholar, DBLP, etc.). 
  The proceedings will be available at the conference in electronic form, and published as printed and online LNCS volumes shortly after the conference.
