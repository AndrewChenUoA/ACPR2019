<h3>Call for Workshops</h3>
<b>The ACPR 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops that will be held on the day before the main conference.</b><br/><br/>
Researchers interested in organizing workshops at ACPR2019 are invited to submit a proposal, which includes the following information:
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Preference for the duration (full day or half day)</li>
<li>Scope and motivation</li>
<li>Topics</li>
<li>Relevance for ACPR</li>
<li>Organizing committee and program committee</li>
<li>Short CV of organizers</li>
</ul>

The Workshop Chairs encourage researchers to submit proposals on recent important topics in pattern recognition (in a wide sense), possibly with a focus on theory, on particular applications, or on both combined. Workshops proposing topics discussing future developments in pattern recognition or real applications are also welcome.<br/><br/>

<h4>Notes</h4>
−	ACPR organizers will handle workshop registration and provide workshop spaces, coffee break catering, and other facilities required to organize workshops (room, data projector, poster stands – as advised by workshop organizers). Registration for workshops is included in the conference registration, i.e., all the registered ACPR participants are free to attend any of the workshops (besides all the sessions of the main conference).<br/>
−	If a workshop incurs costs for invited speakers, the workshop organizers are required to cover those costs by their own arrangements. The workshop organizers may solicit sponsorship to cover the relevant costs; sponsorships will be acknowledged as explained on the ACPR sponsorship website. Invited workshop speakers will be provided free registration by the ACPR organizer.<br/><br/>
