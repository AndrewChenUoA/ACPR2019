<h3>Conference Registration</h3>
Each participant in the conference must be registered and the registration fee paid. One regular registration covers the publication of a maximum of three papers in the conference proceedings. If two or more co-authors of the same paper(s) participate in the conference, they must all be registered and the registration fees paid.<br/><br/>

The registration fee includes participation to workshops, tutorials, and to the main conference, conference materials, coffee breaks, lunches, social events and conference dinner.<br/><br/>

Papers with no registration fee paid by 1 October will not be included in the electronic conference materials (on a memory stick); conference proceedings are published by Springer after the conference containing all the accepted papers presented by one of the co-authors in person at the workshops or at the main conference.<br/><br/>

<b>A link to the registration page will be active here in August.</b> It is possible to pay late registration fees at the conference (except for authors, as papers need to be registered by 1 October), or to purchase individual tickets for side events, using credit cards at the registration booth. Only Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are accepted.<br/><br/>
