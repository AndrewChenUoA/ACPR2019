<h3>Conference Registration</h3>

<h4><a href="https://aut.ungerboeck.com/prod/emc00/register.aspx?OrgCode=10&EvtID=21813&AppCode=REG&CC=119081503651">Register Here</a></h4>

Each participant in the conference must be registered and the registration fee paid. One regular registration covers the publication of a maximum of three papers in the conference proceedings. If two or more co-authors of the same paper(s) participate in the conference, they must all be registered and the registration fees paid. You do not have to be an author to attend. If you are not an author, please follow the registration process and leave the â€œpaper(s)" field blank.<br/><br/>

The registration fee (both categories, Regular or Student) includes participation to workshops, tutorials, and to the main conference, conference materials, coffee breaks, lunches, social events, and conference dinner.<br/><br/>

Papers with no registration fee paid by 1 October will not be included in the electronic conference materials (on a memory stick); conference proceedings are published by Springer after the conference containing all the accepted papers presented by one of the co-authors in person at the workshops or at the main conference.<br/><br/>

It is possible to pay late registration fees at the conference (except for authors, as papers need to be registered by 1 October), or to purchase individual tickets for side events, using credit cards at the registration booth. Only Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are accepted.<br/><br/>
