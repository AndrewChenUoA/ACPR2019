<h3>Call for Demonstrations or Exhibitions</h3>
<b>The ACPR 2019 Organizing Committee invites proposals for Demos, to be presented in parallel to the main conference, November 27 – 29, 2019.</b><br/><br/>

The 5th Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR 2019) is pleased to invite researchers and industry to submit applications for presenting live demos (short for demonstrations or exhibitions) as an opportunity to showcase their research, systems or products to conference attendees.<br/><br/>

Researchers or companies in pattern recognition and related disciplines are invited to submit an application to present at assigned demo spaces during ACPR 2019.<br/><br/>

Academic or industrial demos are not limited to papers accepted to ACPR 2019 or its workshops. Any demo is welcome, showcasing the effectiveness of pattern recognition methods or of related products. There will be a fee for industrial demos, depending on required space; ACPR sponsorship may waive this fee (see ACPR sponsor page).<br/><br/>

Demo space is limited. All submissions will be reviewed and answered within two weeks. Submission opportunity ends if available demo space is taken.<br/><br/>

Demo applicants should fill out a <i>Demo Expression of Interest</i>, describing the demo, required space and power/net connections, and planned or possible activities (e.g. possible brief tutorials at demo desk, distribution of material), and email it together with any supporting material to one of the Demo Chairs. The Demo Chairs will select demons based on their relevance to ACPR 2019 and their scientific and technical merit. For all accepted demos, the physical presence of at least one presenter during the entire Demo Session is required. The presenter(s) must be registered for ACPR 2019.<br/><br/>

<b>The best demo will be awarded the ACPR 2019 Best Demo Prize.</b><br/><br/>
