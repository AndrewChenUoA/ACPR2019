Conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s LNCS series after the conference.<br/><br/>
Your final paper and the signed copyright form are due on October 1st, 2019, 23:59 PT (Pacific Time). The camera-ready paper is limited to a maximum of 14 pages (including references).<br/><br/>
Please follow the following steps to submit your final (camera-ready) version of your paper for distribution at ACPR 2019:<br/>
1.	Revise your paper based on reviewers’ comments.<br/>
2.	Check PDF file compliance with Lecture Notes in Computer Science(LNCS) format (e.g.. pay attention to the proper format in your bibliography).<br/>
