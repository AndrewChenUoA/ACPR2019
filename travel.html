<h3>Travel and Accommodation</h3>
Auckland is a vibrant and exciting city with lots to see and do. It is New Zealand's largest city and considered by many the Gateway to the Pacific. While you're here, take the opportunity to explore the city. For a comprehensive overview of Auckland, go to <a href="www.aucklandnz.com">www.aucklandnz.com</a>.<br/><br/>
The nearest airport is <b>Auckland Airport</b> [-37.008187, 174.785063]. Many direct international flights are available, although some flights may need to be directed through Australia. Make sure that you book a flight to Auckland, New Zealand, and <b>not</b> Oakland in the US.<br/>


<h3>Arriving in New Zealand</h3>
After collecting your baggage at the airport, proceed to the exiting point where your passenger arrival card will be checked by an officer prior to passing through Customs and the New Zealand quarantine inspection service.<br/>

Don't forget to declare any necessary items including food, bones, shells. There are severe penalties for failing to declare articles that are prohibited, restricted or for which you are required to pay duty/sales tax. No fruit is allowed into NZ (along with a list of other items that you will see on the customs declaration form).<br/><br/>

Also, every passenger carrying NZ$10,000 or more in cash and/or foreign currency equivalent must notify a Customs officer. Travelex is the world's foreign exchange specialist, with 10 stores located in the international and domestic terminals for changing money. Banks are also available in the city if you wish to exchange money there or at any other exchange (readily available).<br/>

<h3>Travel to CBD from Airport</h3>
Several transport options are available for getting to and from Auckland Airport (a number of bus, shuttle, and taxi services which can pick up from the terminal forecourts). A regular 15-minute Airbus Express service is available from the airport for all travellers to Auckland's CBD and to the city's waterfront Downtown Ferry Terminal.<br/><br/>

Taxi and shuttle ranks are located outside the arrivals area (door 8) at the international terminal and outside the luggage collection area (door 4) at the domestic terminal. You can pre-book with one of the companies listed below or just turn up at the terminal ranks - taxis and shuttles are always available. Indicative fares from the airport into the city is between NZ$65 - NZ$85 one-way for a taxi and shuttles ($33 for one person plus $8 for each extra person together in the same group). For specific fare pricing, contact the taxi and shuttle companies directly.<br/>
